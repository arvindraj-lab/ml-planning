#### 1. Model used today (include version: e.g granite.13b.usecase.v1):

#### 2. Upgrading to model version/release/modification (e.g v2 or v1.1):  

#### 3. Data Centers requested:

- new workload estimates (input tokens per month):

#### 5. What is your A/B testing plan including environment:

#### 6. Target date of go-live in production:

- Note the "go-live in production" date must be before the model withdrawal date as determined by the model deprecation process.

#### 7. Transition period
- [ ] We will "rip & replace" older model with new model and not have a transition period to support both [only for minor release, modifications, not for version changes]
- [ ] We need to support both models (and workloads) for a period as we go-live
- Migration window [start/end]:

#### 8. Model approval:
- DCT number: 
- [ ] Our reuse of the model has now been approved
- Include email approval screenshot
- [ ] No new approval is needed as this is a not a version change (e.g not v1 to v2, but instead v1 to v1.1)
